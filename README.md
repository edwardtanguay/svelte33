# svelte33

This is a project template for a single-page Svelte web site. 

It uses SASS, Bootstrap 4, and works out-of-the-box at Netlify, see [these instructions](https://onespace.netlify.app/howtos?id=332) for publishing at Netlify.

It also reads from a JSON file, and allows the user to search the items via text box with results shows as they type, which demonstrates how to use events and the interaction between components.

## Set-up

Clone this code to a local directory, then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

In browser, view site at: http://localhost:5000
